I’m a machine learning PhD student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">McGill University</a> and <a href="http://mila.quebec/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mila</a>, supervised by <a href="siamak.page">Siamak Ravanbakhsh</a>. I work on generative models, geometric deep learning, and applications to materials science, physics, and chemistry. Right now I’m particularly interested in AI-guided materials discovery, equivariant graph neural networks, and incorporating symmetry into generative models.</p> <p>Before McGill, I did my undergrad at the University of British Columbia in Physics and Computer Science, and worked for a year as a software developer at Amazon.</p> </body></html>
