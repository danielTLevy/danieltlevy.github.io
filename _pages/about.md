Hi! I'm a machine learning PhD student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila](http://mila.quebec/), supervised by [Siamak Ravanbakhsh](siamak.page). I work on generative models, geometric deep learning, and applications to materials science, physics, and chemistry.
Right now I'm particularly interested in AI-guided materials discovery, equivariant graph neural networks, and incorporating symmetry into generative models.

Before McGill, I did my undergrad at the University of British Columbia in Physics and Computer Science, and worked for a year as a software developer at Amazon.
